## Introduction
In this project, you will build a Github repository from scratch and create a scaffolding that will assist you in performing both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. You'll use Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. Next, you'll integrate this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## First: CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Architectural Diagram - CI - GitHub Actions

### Instructions

* Enter to Azure Portal with your Accoutn and open a Azure Cloud shell ( use Bash)
 - If you are not created one , just follow the first creation and wait a seconds to get your Cloud Shell 

* First of all set up SSH Keys in your azure cloud shell, add the `id_rsa.pub` key to your GitHub repo ( ssh keys)  and then clone the project there.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
 cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

![alt text](https://github.com/jfcb853/Udacity-DevOps-Azure-Project-2/blob/main/images/screen%201%20-%20cloning%20repo.png)

* Change to branch "hello-github-actions" 
```sh
 git checkout hello-github-actions
```

* Project Scaffolding ( files):

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Makefile | to create shortcuts to build, test, and deploy a project|
| requirements.txt| to list what packages a project needs |
| hello.py | a basic python app |
| test_hello.py | the test python file to above app|


* Create a virtual environment for your application.
```sh
python3 -m venv ~/.myrepo
source ~/.myrepo/bin/activate
```

* Run `make all` which will install, lint, and test code
```sh
make all
```

* Next set up Github Actions in your repo by adding the `main.yml file present in the .github/workflows folder.

```sh
ls -lasth .github/workflows/main.yml
```
![alt text](https://github.com/jfcb853/Udacity-DevOps-Azure-Project-2/blob/main/images/screen%203%20-%20github%20actions%20workflow%20build%20-%20OK.png)

Note: Weâ€™ve created a simple GitHUB Action in the repo which automates the lint  and test of our app.
Note: You can add the GitHub Actions badge to you README.md ( it's a good practice to do that)

* (OPTIONAL but HIGHLY Recommended) - Also you can add a CI pipeline with CircleCI.

- Open your account in CircleCI , add your repo and copy the `config.yml` of directory `.circleci`
```sh
ls -lasth .circleci/config.yml
```
Note:  this article that Noah wrote on the topic ( https://circleci.com/blog/increase-reliability-in-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-circleci/) 


## Second : CI/CD Pipeline with AZURE DEVOPS

* Return to the `main` branch
```sh
git checkout main
git branch
```

### Azure DevOps Pipelines Architectural Diagram

* Architectural Diagram - ![alt text](https://github.com/jfcb853/Udacity-DevOps-Azure-Project-2/blob/main/images/cd-diagram.png)

* Go to Azure Devops page  and sign in it, create a new Project inside your organization ( if you don't have an organization create one first).

* In your new Project in Azure DevOps, go to Project Settings and create a new `Pipeline --> Service Connection` as is explained on the YouTube video link  below ( Service Connection must be of Type Azure Resource Manager)

> Note 1 : Name your Service Connection `AZServiceConnection`
> Note 2: Use a link of as this `https://dev.azure.com/<organization>/<project_name>/_apis/serviceendpoint/endpoints?api-version=5.0-preview.2`  to find your ServiceConnectionID ( take note of this number since you will needed in the yaml file to build the pipeline). Replace the values for the ones that you created for your organization and project name.
Note3: the ServiceConnection ID is the number before the name `AZServiceConnection` of the above link.

* In  your new Project in Azure DevOps, go to Pipelines -->New Pipeline --> GitHub --> Select Your Repo --. select an Existing YAML file'
- Choose the `main` branch and the file named `azure-pipelines.yml` as is showed on the figure below

![alt text](https://github.com/jfcb853/Udacity-DevOps-Azure-Project-2/blob/main/images/screen%205%20-%20creating%20azure%20pipeline.png)

* After successfully configuring Azure pipelines and github actions check that if you make any commit then the pipeline is triggered and it runs but with no success!!!

![alt text](<link here>)

> NOTE 1: As first attempt the Pipeline must fails !!!!
> NOTE 2: Why? Due two important things. You are not created your webapp yet in azure , and you must modify the ServiceConnection and the name of your webapp on the `azure-pipelines.yml` file for the ones that you got.


* Deploy the flask-sklearn app to Azure app Service ( using Plan B1)  with this command ( Create a webapp and deploy code from a local workspace to the app):

```sh
az webapp up -n <name of webapp> --location southcentralus --sku B1
```

>Note 1: If you don't choose the sku , the default will be `P1V2(Premium V2 Small)` ( brings more costs associated)
>Note 2 : the name of your app must be unique!!!
>Note 3: This operation can take a while to complete ...


![alt text](<insert here>)

*  Update the `azure-pipelines.yml` with the name of your webapp and your service connection point ( Check YouTube video for a detailed explanation)

> Modifications are at variables webAppName & environmentName

* Your service URL  will be something like this : https://<name of webapp>.azurewebsites.net/

* Update the file `make_predict_azure_app.sh` with your end point

```sh
grep https make_predict_azure_app.sh
```

* perform a cosmetic change to your app.py , so you can see your CI/CD pipeline in action on Azure DevOps/

- On file `app.py` change this line:

```sh
html = "<h3">Sklearn Prediction Home</h3>"
```

for this one:

```sh
html = "<h2>Sklearn Prediction Home App RestAPI</h2>"
```

and then perform a quick lint and push the changes to your repo:

```sh
make lint
git add .
git commit -m "app.py updated"
git push origin main
```

* When the app is successfully deployed then update the app service endpoint in the code and then run script `./make_predict_azure_app` file to make a prediction.

* You will be able to see the successfully prediction made:

```sh
./make_predict_azure_app.sh
```

Answer:

```sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Logging: Check on webapp log tail `az webapp log tail` , the answer like this:

* Run locust command in your project to perform a load test on the API. You can see an output like this.

> Azure cloud Shell is not enough good to perform locust there, so use a VM or your own machine to perform locust

> copy both files (`loadtesting.sh` & `locustfile.py ` ) and run the `loadtesting.sh` file and open the broser on `http://localhost:8089/` :

```sh
./loadtesting.sh
```

>from there you can see how the load testing is performing and how you app established on a # of RPS 
> This is good to know how good is your webapp and your plan to manage the requests. So you can decide to scale up the plan service of your webapp for example.
-> Locust could generate a stats report.

## CLEAN OUT

* delete the resource group of your webapp created.

> At portal enter to your webapp service , locate the resource group.
> Go to that resource group and delete it.


## Future Enhancements

* Adding more test cases.
* Creating a UI for making predictions.
* Using Github Actions instead of Azure pipelines.
* Run the app on Kubernetes cluster
